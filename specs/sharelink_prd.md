# PRD: PeerShare - Real-time P2P Screen Sharing and Video Calling Platform

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: PeerShare - Real-time P2P Screen Sharing and Video Calling Platform
- Version: 2.1 (Chat & Group-Based)

### 1.2 Product summary
PeerShare is a modern, low-latency screen sharing and video calling application built around persistent groups and channels, intelligently using peer-to-peer connections for 1:1 calls and SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit) architecture for group calls. Built with WebRTC at its core, the platform provides Discord-like functionality with robust NAT traversal, high-quality screen sharing using `getDisplayMedia()`, and enterprise-grade reliability.

The application targets small teams, remote developers, and online tutors who need reliable, low-latency real-time collaboration within organized groups and channels. By leveraging P2P for direct connections and falling back to SFU for scalability, PeerShare optimizes for both performance and cost-effectiveness while maintaining consistent user experience across web and native platforms. Users create or join persistent groups, participate in text channels, and initiate voice/video calls directly from their group context.

## 6. Narrative

Alex is a remote software developer working in a distributed team of 8 engineers. His team uses PeerShare to organize their communication around different projects, each with dedicated channels for planning, code reviews, and general discussion. When Alex needs to pair program on a complex feature, he joins the "Backend Development" voice channel where his teammate Sarah is already present, and they automatically establish a P2P connection for low-latency screen sharing. As they work through the code, other team members can see they're collaborating and choose to join for input or simply monitor progress. When their team lead drops in for a quick architecture review, PeerShare seamlessly transitions to SFU mode, and the session recording captures important decisions for the entire team's future reference. The organized group structure ensures all communication and collaboration happens in context, making it easy for team members to stay informed and contribute when needed.
