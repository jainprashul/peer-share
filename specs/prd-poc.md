# PRD: PeerShare POC - Minimal Group-Based P2P Video Calling

## 1. Product overview

### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: PeerShare POC - Minimal Group-Based P2P Video Calling
- Version: 1.0 (POC)

### 1.2 Product summary
PeerShare POC is a simplified proof-of-concept application that validates the core concept of group-based peer-to-peer video calling with screen sharing. The POC focuses on essential WebRTC functionality within a basic group structure, allowing users to create simple groups, join voice channels, and establish P2P connections with screen sharing capabilities.

The POC targets small development teams (2-5 members) who need to validate the technical feasibility and user experience of group-based P2P collaboration. This minimal version proves the concept before investing in full SFU infrastructure, advanced UI, or complex permission systems.

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Business goals
- Validate P2P WebRTC connectivity and reliability in real-world networks
- Test user adoption of group-based collaboration model vs traditional room-based approach
- Measure screen sharing quality and performance across different devices
- Gather feedback on core UX patterns for group navigation and call initiation

### 2.2 User goals
- Create simple groups and invite team members
- Join voice channels and establish P2P video calls within 30 seconds
- Share screens with acceptable quality (â‰¥10fps) during calls
- Experience seamless group-based workflow for team collaboration

### 2.3 Non-goals
- SFU infrastructure (limit to P2P only, max 2 participants per call)
- Advanced authentication (simple username-based access)
- Recording functionality
- Mobile applications
- Advanced UI/UX polish
- Production-grade scalability
- TURN server deployment (STUN only)

## 3. User personas

- **Beta Testers**: Technical early adopters who provide feedback on new collaboration tools and workflows

### 3.3 Role-based access
- **Group Creator**: Creates group and can invite members (basic admin)
- **Group Members**: Can join voice channels and participate in calls
- **Guests**: Join via invite links with same functionality as members (no distinction in POC)

## 4. Functional requirements

- Share invite links via copy/paste
- No signup required - username-based identification only

### 5.2 Core experience
- **Group Creation**: User enters group name and username, gets shareable invite link
  - Minimal form with just group name and personal username fields
- **Joining**: Users click invite link, enter their username, and see group voice channel
  - Simple landing page with username input and "Join Group" button
- **Voice Channel**: Single voice channel shows online members and "Join Call" button
  - Basic participant list with online indicators and single call button
- **P2P Call**: Two users can connect directly with video, audio, and screen sharing
  - Simple call interface with basic controls and connection status
- **Screen Sharing**: One-click screen sharing with source selection
  - Browser native screen selection with basic start/stop controls

### 5.3 Advanced features & edge cases
- Basic error handling for connection failures
- Simple reconnection on network interruption
- Basic browser compatibility detection

### 5.4 UI/UX highlights
- Minimal, functional interface focused on core workflow
- Clear connection status indicators
- Simple, intuitive call controls
- Basic responsive design for desktop browsers

## 6. Narrative

Sarah and Mike are developers on a small team who need to quickly review code together. Sarah creates a PeerShare group called "Dev Team" and shares the invite link with Mike. Mike clicks the link, enters his name, and immediately sees Sarah online in the voice channel. With one click, they start a P2P video call, and Sarah shares her screen to show the code changes. The simple interface lets them focus on collaboration without complex setup or navigation, proving that group-based P2P calling can work seamlessly for small teams.

## 7. Success metrics

### 7.1 User-centric metrics
- P2P connection success rate: target >70% without TURN servers
- Time to establish call: target <45 seconds from group join
- Screen sharing activation rate: measure user engagement with feature
- Session duration: validate if users find value in extended collaboration

### 7.2 Business metrics
- Group creation rate and invite sharing patterns
- User retention over 1-week period
- Feedback quality and feature request patterns

### 7.3 Technical metrics
- WebRTC connection establishment success rate
- Screen sharing frame rate and quality measurements
- Browser compatibility and error rates
- Network condition impact on call quality

## 8. Technical considerations

### 8.1 Integration points
- WebRTC browser APIs: getUserMedia, getDisplayMedia, RTCPeerConnection
- Basic WebSocket server for signaling (Node.js + Socket.IO)
- STUN servers for NAT traversal (public STUN servers only)
